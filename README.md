# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to **analyze sentiments** (positive, negative, neutral) from tweets using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.
Currently, the implementation is **partially complete** — the core sentiment analysis pipeline is in progress, but certain features such as full data cleaning, advanced model training, and visualization are pending.
I plan to **complete and optimize** the project in the near future.

## 📅 Current Progress

✅ **Completed**

* Basic Twitter data extraction (via Tweepy / Twitter API).
* Initial preprocessing of tweets (lowercasing, removing special characters, stopwords removal).
* Preliminary sentiment analysis using a simple NLP model (e.g., TextBlob / VADER).

⏳ **Pending**

* Advanced preprocessing (lemmatization, handling emojis, hashtags).
* Model training with machine learning / deep learning (e.g., Logistic Regression, LSTM, BERT).
* Visualization of sentiment distribution.
* Web/GUI interface for live tweet sentiment monitoring.
* Deployment (Heroku / Streamlit).
